        <div>Untouchable
        <p>     When machine fall in love with human being, what would it be like? Just like joi, officer K’s
                AI girlfriend, she fall in love with k, however, she can never truelly feel, what it would be like, 
                when you have a body touch with your lover.
                
                so we made a interactive installation with shadow effect. when the experiencer enter into the 
                installation, they can see through the hole. at the same time, the experiencer’s activity is limited
                (just like machine) then open the two lights, which be worn on arms. and the shadow of 
                experiencer’s hand will be showed on wall.—— „machine“ own a fiction version body, the shadow
                can contact the lover in front, but can never touch the real body.
                
                through the installation, we hope that the experiencer can feel the untouchable love between human ,
                and machine, and to consider the future and relationship between machine and human.
